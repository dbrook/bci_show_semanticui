Profit Centers are always the format of PC-$(boothNum)$(letter): "PC-100A"
Power Buys do not have any relation to the booth number.
TODO: ask Mollie what the Power Buys (PB-*) numbers are like
-> We might be able to radically simplify the data structure if so
-> Actually, don't mess with it, just enforce it in the UI

NEW PAGE (TAB): Full editing of a booth:
- Drop down at top with booths with actions
- Display Visit Status, Open Stock Forms, Questions, PB, PC
- "Add Item" button in each section
- Page is opened when clicking the booth number in the Summary Tab

Vendors and Summary could be unified?
- It would make the mobile view a fucking mess though




Data Structure Changes:
-----------------------
- From actions:
    - Remove "visit" field
    - "openStockForm" shall become an array with a value and name
    - Add a "notes" field that will be like questions but without answers
- New array: "notes", just a string and itmIdx
- New top-level field: "version" (null or "1" for version 1, "2" for version 2)

GUI Changes:
-----------
- Tasks Tab:
    - Rename to "PB/PC"
    - Remove Questions display
- Summary Tab:
    - Render Open Stock Form as a count like all others
    - Remove "Visit" button
    - Add a note icon where "Visit" used to be
    - Clicking the Booth number button takes you to the dedicated Vendor Tab
- Map Tab
    - Switch to <div> style rendering
    - Make clicking a <div> go to the Add Task Modal (or dedicated Tab opened to vendor)
    - Outline color to be based on ... questions!
- Remove Visit Widget(s)
- Remove Visit Modal
- Add Task Modal:
    - Swap "Visit" with "Note" in Add Task Modal
    - Pre-populate the Profit Center: PC-$boothNum-$identifier: eg: PC-100A, only fill in "A"
    -
- *New* Tab: "Vendor"
    - Upper section for drop-down: select an active booth
    - Note "alert" field(s) at the top
    - Flex container with:
        a) Open Stock form + (add button), keeping same states
        b) Question+answers widget + add button
        c) PB/PC section
- Rename "Vendors" to "Booths" (for all show booths)
- New tab order:
    1) Booths, 2) Summary, 3) Map, 4) Vendor, 5) PB/PC

Data Changes:
-------------
These changes will allow both versions of the GUI to exist for a user.
We'll keep the upstream data sources the same, but flag the save file with
a new field "version". If "version" is not present, assume version 1 data.
Tasks:
- Prefix the IndexedDB Name of tables with the version number and a dash:
    "2-2023-Fall-ACY" will be tables with version 2 data
- Local Storage version 2 GUI key: "BciTradeShow2Current"
